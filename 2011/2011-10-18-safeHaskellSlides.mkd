I presented a talk this year at the Haskell Implementors Workshop over in
Tokyo. It was a great time, attending some very interesting talks and meeting
up with old and new friends in the Haskell and Functional Programming
community. My talk was on [Safe
Haskell](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~davidt/safehaskell.html), an extension
recently added to GHC that I've been working on with [David
Mazi&egrave;res](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), [Simon
Marlow](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonmar/) and [Simon Peyton
Jones](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/). I want to write a
blog post about it at some point, but for now here are the slides from the
talk:
